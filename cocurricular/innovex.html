                                    latest urban development plan was released by the BMC in 2015. This data was made
                                    available to the public. The format, however, was not really in a manner that could
                                    be easily understood; or used. It was just raw data. Using GIS, this system aims at
                                    improving the quality of the provided data. The information will be digitalized and
                                    added to the survey maps provided by the BMC. This mapping will be done over in
                                    several steps and will require various software such as QGIS, GeoNode, Cartoview,
                                    ODK, etc. This platform will provide a much better and understandable data format.

                                <td>This tool is used for detecting the percentage of plagiarism of source code between
                                    two or more java files (i.e. .java). While detecting the plagiarism between the
                                    files it will use the three approaches i.e. Software metrics, Cosine Similarity and
                                    Machine Learning. In Software metrices approach it will check the structure of the
                                    files i.e. number of open and closed braces, function name, percentage of pure
                                    comment lines, average indentation in tabs and white spaces after open braces,
                                    program line length in term of characters, etc. In Cosine Similarity approach it
                                    will check the similarity between the files on the basis of frequency of unique word
                                    count. In Machine Learning approach it will generate rules and patterns on the basis
                                    of clusters formed. Finally it will generate the appropriate result from these
                                    approaches and on the basis of that result it will determined the percentage of
                                    plagiarism between the files.</td>
